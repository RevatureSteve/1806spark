	 * 	Spring MVC Notes:
	 * 		First Note: Spring MVC was built originally
	 * 				with template engines in mind
	 * 		Template Engines aka html engines
	 * 			Used for Server-side Rendering
	 * 		Examples of Template Engines: JSP, Groovy, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker
	 * 		We need to know both - REST vs Server-side Rendering Diagrams
	 * 
	 * 		FrontController DesignPattern - One servlet handling all
	 * 			requests:
	 * 		Once an HttpRequest hits the Spring Servlet
	 * 			the servlet forwards the request to the appropriate
	 * 			Controller
	 * 
	 * 	Spring MVC @s: @Controller, @RestController,
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 	Spring MVC Setup (non-boot): 
	 * 		0. create spring bean configuration file in WEB-INF
	 * 		1. 
	 * 		turn on
