Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM Projects after pulling is to run the command:
npm install
npm start

BUT when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm install works but NOT npm start--you must add this!
For example look at a generated angular project's package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project, but again look at the package.json
npm start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute
        ng serve

so if Project 1 is only an npm project (has a package.json) and not an angular
    you must add start to your package.json scripts, which would look like:
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
    }

Angular has a CLI built on top of NPM called...Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
Examples of CLIs: ng (Angular), NPM, node,
namespaces, pass parameter to instruction set/script
[namespace corresponding to environment variable and path]

Need to install angular CLI?
npm install -g @angular/cli

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the < >

then use
    ng serve
under the project-name folder

Data Binding: 1-way & 2-way

what does {{}} Angular Expression
TS file -> HTML file
1-way data Binding
from what to what? well, we're only talking about components
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts
    Data Binding means sharing the same data between them


mini assignment: create a project, generate 2 components
        and use angular {{}} to print 2 separate values to the html files
