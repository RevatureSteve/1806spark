    <h2><font color="red"> A new growing industry is now booming, and the product is human flesh. The consumers do not discriminate
        between sex, age, or race. This means we all are at risk of being a target. Over 20 million adults and children fall
        victim into this heart breaking predicament. Sadly, the ones orchestrating the trade offs are at times close friends
        and family. </font></h2>
