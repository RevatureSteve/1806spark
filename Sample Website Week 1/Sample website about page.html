    <body> <h1> About Us</h1> <br>
        Crazy Steve's has been a fixture of the gently used car and exotic animal markets since he opened his first dealership in Boise, Conneticut, in 1974. Since then, through hard work and clever naivigation of the legal system, Crazy Steve has expanded his empire across the four corners of the tristate area. At present, Crazy Steve's Used Car and Exotic Animal emporium is the the undisputed fourth best small to midsized used car dealership in Connecticut. <br>
