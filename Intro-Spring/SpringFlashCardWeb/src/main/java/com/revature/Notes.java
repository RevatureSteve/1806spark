	/*
	 * 	Spring MVC Notes:
	 * 		First Note: Spring MVC was built originally 
	 * 				with template engines in mind
	 * 		Template Engines aka html engines
	 * 			Used for Server-side Rendering
	 * 		Examples of Template Engines: JSP, Groovy, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker
	 * 		We need to know both - Rest vs Server-side Rendering Diagrams!
	 * 		
	 * 		FrontController DesignPattern - One servlet handling ALL
	 * 			requests:
	 * 		Once an HttpRequest hits the Spring Servlet
	 * 			THE servlet forwards the request to the appropriate 
	 * 			Controller
	 * 
	 * 	Spring MVC @s: @Controller, @RestController, 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 	Spring MVC Setup (non-boot): 
	 * 		0. create spring bean configuration file in WEB-INF
	 * 		1. (beans.xml) turn on context component scan
	 * 		2. (beans.xml) turn on mvc annotation-driven
	 * 		3. (web.xml) map the one and only servlet with requests to it!
	 *
