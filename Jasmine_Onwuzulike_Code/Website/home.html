<h3>35mm Film Photography</h3>
<div id = "home-info">
<p>The term 35 mm camera usually refers to a still photographic film camera which uses the 35 mm format on 135 film. Such cameras have been produced by Leica, Kodak, Nikon, Canon, Minolta, Olympus, Contax, Pentax, Carl Zeiss, Fujifilm, and numerous other companies.</p>
<p>Getting started with film photography is relatively easy. A decent 35mm camera can be found for less that $100. Ask relatives, thrift stores and antique stores. You can also use eBay, but the prices may not be as good/as reliable.</p>
<p>The 35mm lens can be used for almost anything: Landscapes, portraits, travel shots, macro photography, street photography, real estate photography, product photography â€“ just about everything.</p>
