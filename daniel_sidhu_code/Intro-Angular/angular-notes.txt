Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM Projects after pulling is to run the Command:
    npm install
    npm start

BUT when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm instal workd but NOT npm start, you must add this!
For emample look at a generated angular project package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project BUT again look at the package.json
npm start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute
    ng serve

SO if project 1 is only an NPM project and not an Angular Project
    then you must add start to your scripts which would look like:
    "script": {
    "start": "node index.js",  
    }

Angular has a CLI built ontop of NPM call Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
examples of CLIs: ng, npm, node, git, java

Need ro install Angualr CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli

Check Angular Version
ng -Version

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the <>

Generate:
ng generate component | service | pipe | ect <name>

Can test it before actually creating/motifying a file with


Angular:

directive: <app-name></app-name> html code
what is the first directive give? <app-root><>/app-root
What is a directive? where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject
    the corresponding html fragment then the style will style that html
    and the ts file will control(like dom manipulation) the html/css
A directive ALWAYS belongs to a component
    like app-root belongs to app.component

component: @component decorator in a ts file!
@component requires 3 things!
    -selector aka the directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template aka html
    -style aka css

Data Binding: 1-way & 2-way

what does {{}} Angular expression
ts file -> html file
1 way data Bindingfrom what to what? well we're only talking about components 
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts

mini assignment: create a project, generate 2 components
    and use angular {{}} to print 2 seperate values to the html files

How to generate a component and what does it create/modify?
    -creates html,css, ts, spec(testing)
    -modifies: adds the component to the app.module
    
What are structural directives?
    there are 3 structural directives for flow control
    -*ngFor
    -*ngIf
    -*ngSwitch
