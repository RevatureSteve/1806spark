heavily use NPM which is an example of popular CLI tool
angular has CLI built on top of NPM called ... Angular CLI`
the standard for NPM Projects after is to run the command 
npm install
npm start

but when creating a new npm project using npm init 
the npm install works but not npm start, you must add this!
for example look at a generated angular project's package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project but again look at the package.jsonnpm
npm start calls ng serve because because the script tag in package.json says to execute
        npm service

so if project 1 is only an npm project(has a package.json) and not angular
you must add start to your package.json scripts which would look like:
    "scripts":{
        "start":"node index.js", // this is the start of you project ...w.e ever you called it!!!
    }

    *** put that script in and used the start to start your project instead of node index.js



CLI: command line interface
Example of CLIS: ng, (angular), npm, node, git, `

need to install angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
the -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer

New angular project
ng new <project-name>
don't include <>

check version
ng -v 

angular:
--------------------------------------------------------
directive: <app-name> </app-name> html code
what is the the first directive given? <app-root> </app-root> 
wha t is a direcive? where is a directive, at runtime it will inject
        the corresponding html fragment then the style will style tha html
        and the file will controll(like dom manipulation) the html/css

a driective ALWAYS belongs to a component
    like app-root belongs to app.component 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

component: @component in a ts file
@component requires 3 things!
        - selector aka directive name like app-root which become <app-root> </app-root>
        - template (html) 
        - style


        data bindimng: 1 way  and 2 way

        what does {{}} angular expression mean?
        one way data bindimng
        from what to what? well we are only talking about components 
            and components only have 3 things: html, css, and typescript
            Data binding mean sharing the same data between them

     *************   google ng g c navbar --dry-run
     **************** --dry-run mean something else rm it from ...

     mini assignment: create an angular project, generate 2 components, 
                        and use angular {{}} to two seperate values to the html files
