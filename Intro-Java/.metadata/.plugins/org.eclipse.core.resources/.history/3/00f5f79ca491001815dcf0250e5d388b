	 * Serializable is a "Marker Interface"
	 * 		Marker Interfaces tells the JVM something special
	 * 		- different per-case.
	 * 		Marker Interfaces have no methods.
	 * 		The something special about Serializable is the whitelisting.
	 * 1. Class must implement Serializable (whitelist)
	 * 		2. Add a serialVersionUID
