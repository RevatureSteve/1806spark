 * What is a thread?
 * INDIVIDUAL TASK, PROCESS
 * Each thread in java gets its own Memory Stack.
 * It will have the access to the same Heap.
 * 
 * MultiThreading...
 * Multiple threads in a single application.
 * 
 * How do we create threads in Java?
 * 	Two ways:
 * Create a class that...
 * -Extends Threads class
 * -implements Runnable.
 * 
 * 
 * two important methods of a thread
 * - run(); contains the code to execute // you NEVER CALL THE RUN METHOD.
 * - start(); creates the new thread, invoke run() on the new thread, terminates the thread.
