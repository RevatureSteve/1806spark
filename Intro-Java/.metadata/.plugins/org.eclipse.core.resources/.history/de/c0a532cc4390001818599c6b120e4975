 * IQ: What is the difference between an error and an exception?
 * Error: Errors happen at runtime or compile time
 * Exception: Exceptions only happen at runtime?
 * 
 * Exceptions: recoverable disrupt in the flow of execution.
 * Error(runtime): fatal disrupt in the flow of execution.
 * examples of runtime errors:
 * - OutOfMemoryError: created too many objects no room left
 * - StackOverflowError: too many plates (methods) on the stack, the stack tips over.
