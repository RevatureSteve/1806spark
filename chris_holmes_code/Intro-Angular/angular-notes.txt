Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM Projects ater pulling is to run the Comman:
npm install
npm start

But when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm install works but NOT npm start, you must add this!
For example look at a generated angular project's package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project BUT again look at the package.json
npms start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute
        ng serve

SO if Project 1 is only an npm project (has a package.json) and not an angular
    you must add start to your package.json scripts which would look like;
    "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    }

Angular has a CLI built ontop of NPM called...Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
Examples of CLIs: ng (Angular), NPM, node, git

Need to install angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
The -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer

Check Angular verion:
ng -v

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't incude the < >
ng serve -o opens the file

Generate:
ng generate component | service | piepe| etc <name>

can i test it before actually creating/modifying a file with ng generate component testname --dry-run

concise version

Angular: 

----------------------------------------
directive: <app-name></app-name> html code
What is the first directive given? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive? where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject
        the corresponding html fragment then the style will stile that html 
        and the ts file will control (like dom manipulation) the html/css
A directive ALWAYS belongs to a component
    like app-root belongs to app.component
----------------------------------------

component: @Component decorator in a ts file!
@Component requires 3 things!
    -selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template aka html
    -styles aka css
------------------------------------------
Data Binding: 1-way & 2-way

what does {{}} Angular Expression
TS file -> HTML file
1 way data binding 
from what to what? well we're only talking about components
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts 
    Data binding means sharing the same data between them

mini assignment: create a project, generate 2 components    
        and use angular {{}} to print 2 separate values to the html files

----------------------------------------------------
How to generate a compoent and what does it create/modify?
    - creates html, css, ts, spec(testing),
    - modifies: adds the component to the app.module


----------------------------------------------------
What are structural directives?
    There are 3 structural directives (mainly flow control)!
    - *ngFor
    - *ngIf
    - *ngSwitch
