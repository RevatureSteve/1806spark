Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM Projects after pulling is run the command:
npm install
npm start

But when creating a new npm project using npm init,
the npm install works but NOT npm start, you must add this!!
Angular has a CLI built on top of NPM called Angular CLI
Need to install Angular CLI:
npm install -g @angular/cli
The -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer


Check Angular version:
ng -v

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the < >

Angular:

directive: <app-name></app-name>
What is the first directive given? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive? where there is a directive, a runtime it will inject
    the corresponding html fragment then the style will style that html
    and the ts file will control(like dom manipulation)the html/css
A directive always belong to a component 
    like app-root belongs to app.component

component : @Component in a ts file!
@Component requires 3 things
    -selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template html
    -styles

Data Binding: 1-way & 2-way

what does {{}} Angular Expression
1 way Binding
from what to what? well we're only talking about components
    and components only have 3 things:
    Data Binding means sharing the same data between them
