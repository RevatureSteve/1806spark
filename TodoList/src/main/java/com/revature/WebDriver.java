	 * Comment for Maven WAR project (web archive)
	 * 
	 * No longer using a main method at all!
	 * 
	 * Tomcat is the entry point (had the main method)
	 * 	we provide servlets to Tomcat to provide logic on how to handle 
	 * requests and send back responses
	 * 
	 * The first 2 things after creating a Maven war project
	 * 	- update java version to 1.8 in pom.xml
	 * -generate web.xml aka deployment descriptor
	 * 		right click on project -> java EE tools
	 * 			>generate deployment descriptor
	 *
