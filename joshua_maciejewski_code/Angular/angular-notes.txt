heavily used npm which is an example of a popular cli tool
angular has a cli built ontop of npm called... angular cli

need to install angular cli
//npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli

-g is for global install 

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the <>

cd into folder

ng serve -o  // o will open it 



Generate:
ng generate component | service | pipe | etc <name>

can test it before atually creating/ modifying a file with 
ng generate component <name> --dry-run

concise version above
ng g c <name> is more concise




CLI: command line interface
Ex: ng (Angular), NPM, node, git

The standard for NPM after pulling is run the command: npm install, then npm start
    BUT when creating a new NPM project using npm init, the npm init works but not start,
        you must add this!
    For example, look at a generator angular projec's package.json.
    ng server is command to run and start an angular project BUT    
        again look at the package.json
    npm start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute
        ng serve

    if project 1 only a npm start (has a package.json) and not an angular project,  
        you must add start to your package.json scripts which would look like:
            "scripts": {
            "start": "node index.js",
            },


Angular

angular directive: <app-name ></app-name>  //needs app-
What is the first directive given? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive? where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject
        the correspondinhg html frament then the style will style that html
        and the ts file will control the html/css (business logic)
A directive always belongs to a componenet
    like app-root belongs to app.component 


component: @componenet in a ts file!
@component requires 3 things
    -selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template aka html 
    -style

    ng generate component navbar  -

    --dry - run  : no changes made.. will show what it is going to change 

    bootstrap - first thing loaded, starting point 


    Data binding: 1-way & 2-way
     
    data binding - sharing the same data between two things

     <!-- what does {{}} Angular expression -->
    TS file => html
     1 way data binding
     from what to what? well we're only talking about componenets and componenets only have 3 things: 
        html, css, ts

-- create an angular project, generate 2 components and use angular {{}} to 
        print 2 separate to the html files

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are structural directives? (mainly flow control)
    -*ngFor
    -*ngIf
    -*ngSwitch


How to generate a componenet and what does it create/modify?
    - creates: html, css, ts, spec(for testing)
    - modifies: adds the component to declarations array in the app.module
