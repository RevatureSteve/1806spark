	 * 	Comment for a Maven WAR project (web archive)
	 * 
	 * 	No longer using a main method at all!
	 * 	Tomcat is the entry point (has the main method)
	 * 		we provide Servlets to Tomcat to provide
	 * 		logic on how to handle Requests and send back
	 * 		Responses
	 * 
	 * 	The 2 first things after creating a Maven War project
	 * 			-update java version to 1.8 in pom.xml
	 * 			-generate the web.xml aka deployment descriptor 
	 * 				(right-click on project -> java EE tools
	 * 					-> generate deployment descriptor stub)
	 * 
	 * 		First: 1-2ish
	 * 		As a class: build a JavaScript tic-tac-toe game
	 * 			create use case: is it 2 player? vs a computer minmax tic-tac-toe algorithum
	 * 			index.html, tictactoe.js, style.css, maybe use package.json
	 * 				good functionality, good design 
	 * 		Second: 2
	 * 		JavaScript Review: 10 question/answer/difficulty a piece
	 * 		Closure, BubbleVsCapture, basics: scopes, hoisting, semicolon injection, datatypes etc, 
	 * 			arrow function syntax, template literal 
	 * 		' '
	 * 		x = 'string'; 
	 * 		`this is a ${x}` that is a template literal
	 * 		Third: -3:30/4 
	 * 		QC style q/a sessions
	 * 		Last 
	 * 		Ethuware: review 10 questions from ethuware as a group
