	 *  IQ: What is the difference between error and exception?
	 *  	Error: Errors can happen at runtime or compile time
	 *  		2 types of errors:
	 *  			runtime
	 *  			compilation
	 *  	Exception: Exceptions only happen at runtime!
	 *  
	 *  	So... then what is the difference between a runtime error and exception?
	 *  
	 *  	Exception: recoverable disrupt in the flow of execution
	 *  	Error (runtime): fatal disrupt in the flow of execution
	 * 			e.g. of runtime errors:
	 * 						-OutOfMemoryError: created too many objects no room left
