	 * finally using a MAven Project!
	 * 		Maven projects give us a pom.xml
	 * 
	 * What is a pom.xml file?
	 * 		pom: porject object model
	 * 		the pom file hold the meta data of the project
	 * 			- name of the project
	 * 			- external libraries aka JARS (dependencies) 
	 * 			- package type e.g. jar or war
	 * 			- version # of the project 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
	 * 			- version # of java 
	 * 
	 * remember that XML, JSON, HTML are not programming languages
	 * 		they are common formats that are a machine and human readable
	 * 
	 * 		*note: if you change the pom.xml in Eclipse/STS
	 * 			you need to right click on project -> mave -> update project
	 * 
	 * 		the pom.xml file replaces the .classpath which is a binary version of the pom.xml file
	 * 
	 * So what actually is Maven?
	 * 		a build tool (to build artifacts: jar or war)
	 * 		a dependency manager (jar manager)
