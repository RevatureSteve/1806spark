	 *  Comment for a Maven WAR project (web archive)

	 * 	No longer using a main method at all!
	 * 	Tomcat is the entry point (had the main method)
	 * 		We provide SErvlets to Tomcat to provide 
	 * 		logic on how to handle requests and send back 
	 * 		Responses
	 * 
	 * 	The 2 first things after creating a Maven War project
	 * 		- update java version to 1.8 in pom.xml
	 * 		- generate the web.xml aka deployment descriptor
	 * 			(right-click on project -> java EE tools
	 * 				-> generate deployment descriptor stub)
