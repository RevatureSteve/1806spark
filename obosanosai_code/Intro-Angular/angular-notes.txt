Heavily use NpM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The Standard for npm projects after pulling is run the Command:
npm install
npm start

But when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm install works but NOT npm start, you must add this!
For example look at a generaated angular project's package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project BUT again look at the package.json
"npm start" calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute
       ng serve

SO if project 1 is only an npm project(has a package.json) and not an angualar
     you must add start to your package.json script which would look like:
     "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
  }

Angular has a CLI ontop of NpM called...Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
Examples of CLIs: ng (Angular), npm, node, git

Need to install angualar CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
The -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer

New Angular project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the < > 
cd <project name>
npm init
npm serve -o
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local

Generate:
ng generate component | service | pipe | etc <name>



Angular:
---------------------------------------------
directive: <app-name></app-name> html code
What is the first directive given when you start your project? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive?
    -where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject
    the corresponding html fragment then the style will style that html 
    and the ts file will control(like dom manipulation) the hmtl/css
A directive always belongs to a component, 
    like app-root belongs to app.component
---------------------------------------------
component: @Component decorator in a ts file!
@Commponent requires 3 things!
     - selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
     -template aka html
     -styles
-----------------------------------------------

Data Binding: 1-way & 2-way

What does {{}} Angular Expression do?
TS file -> HTML file
1 way data binding
from what to what? well we're only talking about components
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts
    Data binding means sharing the same data between them


mini assignment: create an angular project, generate 2 components
         and use angular {{}} to print 2 separate values to the html files.

-----------------------------------------------
How to generate a component and what does it create/modify?
     -creates html, css, ts, spec(for testing)
     -modifies: adds the component to the app.module
-----------------------------------------------

What are structural directives?
     There are 3 structural directives (mainly flow control)
     -*ngFor
     -*ngIf
     -*ngSwitch
