	 * Spring MVC notes:
	 *     First Note: Spring MVC was built originally 
	 *              with template engines in mind
	 *     Template Engines aka html engines
	 *           Used for Server-side Rendering
	 *     Examples of Template Engines: JSp, Groovy, Thymeleaf, FreeMarker
	 *     We need to know both - Rest vs Server-side Rending Diagrams!
	 *     
	 *     FrontController Designpattern - One servlet handling ALL
	 *          requests:
	 *     Once an HttpRequest hits the Spring Servlet
	 *          THE servlet forwards the request to the appropriate
	 *          Controller
	 *          
	 * Spring MVC @s: @Contoller, @RestController,
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Spring MVC Setup (non-boot): 
	 *        0. create spring bean config file in WEB_INF
	 *        1. (beans.xml)turn on context component scan
	 *        2. (beans.xml)turn on mvc annotattion-driven
	 *        3. (web.xml) map the one an donly servlet wth all requests to it!
