/*		
 *
 *		Need multiple objects (records) from the database?
 * 		Use a Collection like List<FlashCard> flashcardL = new ArrayList<>();
 * 
 * 
 * 		3 Layers in Java Enterprise Architecture
 * 			1. Presentation: display data (a POJO's current state) to the user and take input
 * 			2. Business Logic: modify input (again, the POJO), redirect user 
 * 					to proper presentations, call persistence methods when needed
 * 			3. Persistence: so far, DAO for CRUD
 * 
 * 		more business logic examples:
 * 			login validation,
 * 			validate models before persisting,
 * 			manipulate models before persisting,
 * 			validate user before pulling sensitive data,
 * 			etc...
 *
 *
 *		reference LoginService from Bank Project for login implementation
