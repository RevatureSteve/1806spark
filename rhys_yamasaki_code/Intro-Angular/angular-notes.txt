Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM projects after pulling is run the Command:
npm install
npm start


But when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm install works but NOT npm start, you must add this!
For example look at a generated angular project's package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project BUT again look at the package.json
nom start calls ng serve because hte script tag in package.json says to
        ng serve

SO if Project 1 is only an npm project (has a package.json) and not an angular
    you must add start to your package.json scripts which would look like:
    "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
    }


Angular has a CLI built ontop of NPM called... Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
Examples of CLIs: ng (Angular), NPM, node, git


Need to install angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
The -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer

Check Angular Version
ng -v

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the < >




Angular

-------------------------------------
directive: <app-name></app-name>
What is the first directive given? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive?  
    Where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject 
    the corresponding html fragment then the style will style that html
    and the ts file will control the html/css
A directive ALWAYS belongs to a component
    like app-root belongs to app.component

-------------------------------------
component: @Component in the ts file!
@Component requires 3 things
    -selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template aka html
    -styles


--------------------------------------
Data Binding: 1-way & 2 ways

what does {{}} Angular Expression
TS file -> HTML file
1 way data Binding
from what to what?  well we're only talking about components 
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts
    Data binding means sharing the same data between them


mini assignment: creat a project, generate 2 components
        and use angular {{}} to print 2 separate values to the html files
