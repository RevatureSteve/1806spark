Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM Projects after pulling is run the Command:
npm install
npm start

BUT when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm install works but NOT npm start, you must add this!
For example look at a generated angular project's package.json
nh serve is the cmd to start an angular project BUT again look at the package.json
npm start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to exectue
        ng serve

SO if Project 1 is only an npm project (has a package.json) and not an angular
    you must add start to your package.json scripts which would look like:
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js",
    }

Angular has a CLI built ontop of NPM called...Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
ex) ng (Angular), NPM, node, git


Need to install angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
The -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer

CHeck Angular Version:
ng -v

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the <>

Generate:
ng generate component | service | pipe | etc <name>

Can test it before actually create/modifying a file with
ng generate component testname --dry-run

Concise version:
ng g c testname --dry-run


Angular:

directive: <app-name></app-name>
What is the 1st directive given? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive? where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject
        the corresponding html fragment then the style sheet will style that html
        and the ts file will control the html/css
A directive ALWAYS belongs to a component
    like app-root belongs to app.component


component: @Component in a ts file!
@Component requires 3 things
    -selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template aka html
    -style


Data Binding: 1-way & 2-way
TS file -> HTML file
what does {{}} Angular Expression
1 way data binding
from what to what? well we're only talking about components
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts
    Data binding means sharing the same data between them

Create an Angular project, generate 2 components
        and use angular {{}} to print 2 separtae values to the html files


There are 3 structural directives (main flow control)
    *ngFor
    *ngIf
    *ngSwitch

How to generate a component and what does it create/modify?
    - create html, css, ts, spec(testing)
    - modifies: adds the component to the app.module
