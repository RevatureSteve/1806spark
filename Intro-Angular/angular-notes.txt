Heavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
The standard for NPM Projects after pulling is run the Command:
npm install
npm start

BUT when creating a new npm project using npm init
the npm install works but NOT npm start, you must add this!
For example look at a generated angular project's package.json
ng serve is the cmd to start an angular project BUT again look at the package.json
npm start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute
        ng serve

SO if Project 1 is only an npm project (has a package.json) and not an angular
    you must add start to your package.json scripts which would look like:
    "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
  }

Angular has a CLI built ontop of NPM called...Angular CLI
CLI: Command Line Interface
Examples of CLIs: ng (Angular), NPM, node, git

Need to install angular CLI:
npm install -g @angular/cli
The -g is global install, making angular available anywhere on the computer

Check Angular Version:
ng -v

New Angular Project:
ng new <project-name>
don't include the  < >


Angular:

-------------------------------------------
directive: <app-name></app-name> html code
What is the first directive given? <app-root></app-root>
What is a directive? where there is a directive, at runtime it will inject
        the corresponding html fragment then the style will style that html
        and the ts file will control(like dom manipulation) the html/css
A directive ALWAYS belongs to a component
    like app-root belongs to app.component

-------------------------------------------
component: @Component in a ts file!
@Component requires 3 things!
    -selector aka directive name like app-root which becomes <app-root></app-root>
    -template aka html 
    -styles

-------------------------------------------
Data Binding: 1-way & 2 way

what does {{}} Angular Expression
TS file -> HTML file
1 way data binding
from what to what? well we're only talking about components
    and components only have 3 things: html, css, ts
    Data binding means sharing the same data between them
 

mini assignment: create an project, generate 2 components
        and use angular {{}} to print 2 separate values to the html files
