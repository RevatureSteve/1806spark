		 * what is a pom.xml?
		 * pom: project object model
		 * the pom file holds the meta data of the project
		 * 		-name of the project
		 * 		-external libraries aka JARS (dependencies)
		 * 		-package type e.g. jar or war
		 * 		-version number of the project 0.01-SNAPSHOT
		 * 		-version of java being used 1.5 right now
		 * 
		 * Remember that xml, HTML, JSON are not programming languages
		 * 	They are common formats that are human and machine readable
		 * i.e. dont do anything on their own, can't be executed 
		 * 
		 * NOTE: if you change the pom.xml in eclipse/sts
		 * 	you need to right click on project -> maven -> update project *
		 * 
		 * the pom.xml file replaces the .classpath which is a binary version of the pom.xml file
		 * 
		 * 		so what actually is Maven?
		 * 			a build tool (to build artifacts: jar or war)
		 * 			a dependency manager (jar manager)
