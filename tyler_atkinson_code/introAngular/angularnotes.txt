HEavily use NPM which is an example of a popular CLI tool
THe Standard for NPM projects after pulling is to run the command npm install, npm start
BUT when creating a new NPM project uisng npm init the npm install works but not npm start, you must add this!
for example look at a generated Angular project, angular project's package .json 

ng serve is the command to start an angular project

npm start calls ng serve because the script tag in package.json says to execute ng serve

if project 1 is only an npm project (has a package.json, and not an angular project) you must add start to your package.json scripts which will look like

 "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
  },

Angular ahs a CLI built on top of NPM called...Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) ng (Angular), NPM, node, git

To install angular CLI  npm install -g @angular/cli  -g is for global install

Check angular version ng -v

New angular project:

ng new <project-name>   dont include<>


to create a project, -ng new project-name
cd into project folder
ng serve

ng g c navbar  - generate component - navbar
