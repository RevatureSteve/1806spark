--**NOTE** what is the difference between truncate and delete
--Delete doesn't require a where clause so it acts the same as a truncate
--BUT truncate is faster because it automatically committed and cannot be rolledback
-- when deleting that will do an extra step for temporarily saving it to a file
-- in case of a rollback, truncate will not do this extra step


--add data to role table, which primarily will be a lookup table
INSERT INTO role VALUES(1, 'Lead');

ORDER BY role_id desc; --to sort by a column e.g. ORDER BY col_name asc/desc

-- Insert roles for actors

INSERT INTO actor_role VALUES(2,5);
INSERT INTO actor_role VALUES(2,1);


--We now have relationships for actors and roles but how can we view them
--Using SQL Joins: joining 2 or more tables for a ResultSet
--Only join on primary key foreign key relationships!
