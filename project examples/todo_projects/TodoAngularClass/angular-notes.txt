(ngSubmit) to submit an angular form asynchronously 
[(ngModel)] helps with input fields for 2 way databinding 
    between template and ts file

But to use these I need to import FormsModule in the app.module.ts
    if you see something like: 
    Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; to the app.module.ts
