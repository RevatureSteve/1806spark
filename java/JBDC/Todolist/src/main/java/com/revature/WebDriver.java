	 *  no longer using a main method at all
	 *  
	 *   tomcat is the enty point (has the main method property)
	 *   	we provide Servlets to tomcat to provide

	 *  
	 *  the first 2 things after creating a maven war project 
	 *  	- update version to 1.8 in pom.xml
	 *   	- generate  the web.xml aka development descriptor
	 *   		(right click on the project--> java EE tools
	 *   			--> generate deployment descriptor stub)
